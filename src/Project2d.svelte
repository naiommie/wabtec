  <p class="my-4">Since QVscribe and OneBot are easier to install, there were less support contact from Wabtec side. 
    However, SES RAT was complex, and we had to contact their support and licensing team in order to get everything work.
    There were cases, where we had to escalate to their sales team, since we couldn't get the answer from licensing team.
